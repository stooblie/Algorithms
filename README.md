# Algorithms
This repository includes several algorithms I have written as part of an algorithms course for the University of Stanford on Coursera.

integer_multiplication.py takes two large numbers and multiplies them in a time efficieint manner by using the KAratsube multiplication method.

count_inversions.py takes an array of unique integers and counts the number of inversions using a time efficient divide and conquer approach.

quick_sort.py uses the QuickSort algorithm to quickly sort a large array of numbers. The program counts the number of times it needs to make a comparison as it runs the sort operation.

min_cut.py takes an adjacency list representation of a simple undirected graph as input. It uses the randomized contraction algorithm to determine the slice of the graph you can take that results in the minimum number of connections between remaining nodes.
